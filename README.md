### About Zero MQ

ZeroMQ is a high performance asynchronous messaging library, aimed to use
in distributed or concurrent applications. It provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware, a ZeroMQ system can run without a 
dedicated message broker

ZeroMQ support common messaging patterns(pub/sub, request/reply, client/server and others) over a variety of transports(TCP, in progress, multicast, WebSocket and more) making interprocess messaging as simple
as inter-thread messaging. This keeps your code clear, modular and extreamly easy to scale.
